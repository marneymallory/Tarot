## Name of Project: 
Moonstone Tarot

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
A Tarot Card app that will provide users with a classic three card spread, providing insight into past, present, and future. 

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
Use a Tarot API to access card images and meanings.
Provide user with three cards at a time, as well as meanings of each card.
Badass styling.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
Tarot API- https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ekswagger/rws-tarot_card_api/1.0.0#/Card
React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, maybe C#?

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Add sign in functionality to save user’s spreads.
Add other numbers of spread options.
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
Identity?

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I’m not sure what I’m doing, but I’m excited about this idea! Will be great if I can get it to work. Not entirely sure how to go about it entirely. Not sure if it would need a C# backend or not. Also, not really sure how to use multiple languages in one application. Am excited for the challenge!


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
