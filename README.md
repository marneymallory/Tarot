## Name of Project: 
Moonstone Tarot

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
A Tarot Card app that will provide users with a classic three card spread, providing insight into past, present, and future. 

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
Use a Tarot API to access card images and meanings.
Provide user with three cards at a time, as well as meanings of each card.
Badass styling.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
Tarot API- https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ekswagger/rws-tarot_card_api/1.0.0#/Card
React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, maybe C#?
React with gesture.

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
Add sign in functionality to save user‚Äôs spreads.
Add other numbers of spread options.
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
Identity?

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing, but I‚Äôm excited about this idea! Will be great if I can get it to work. Not entirely sure how to go about it entirely. Not sure if it would need a C# backend or not. Also, not really sure how to use multiple languages in one application. Am excited for the challenge!


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## React Independent Project: Week 2

### 7/2/21 by Marney Mallory

## Description

This week's independent project was to build a React web application that would enable a bar or kombucha store to track their kegs. 

## Objectives 

- As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to  see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
- As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
- As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
- As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/marneymallory/BoochCity`.
2. Navigate to the `BoochCity/` directory on your computer.
3. Open with your preferred text editor to view the code base.
4. To start a development server and view the project in the browser:

    * _Navigate to `BoochCity/` in your command line_
    * _Run the command `npm install` to install dependencies_
    * _Optionally, run the command `npm run build` to make a bundle of the files_
    * _Finally, run the command `npm run start` to start a development server_

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
